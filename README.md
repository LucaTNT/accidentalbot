accidentalbot
=============

Node/websockets based IRC bot.

Work in progress.

In the `webclient/` directory there is a javascript and HTML file that
show the general idea behind how a client would work.

Configuration is via the environment variable `CHANNEL`.

An example implementation can be found on the [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net)
channel `#atpfm`. The user is `accidentalbot`. The associated web page is
[`www.caseyliss.com/showbot`](http://www.caseyliss.com/showbot).
